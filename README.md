# ☕ MR.COFFEE – Roasted with Love, Served with Passion

Final project for **Human-Computer Interaction** course.  
I designed and developed a responsive website for **MR.COFFEE**, a fictional coffee shop known for its cozy vibes, artistic charm, and community spirit. The site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and emphasizes intuitive design, usability, and mobile responsiveness.
