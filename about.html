                        <p>Susanto Liman’s passion for coffee began long before he founded MR.COFFEE. As a young entrepreneur, Susanto sought to create more than just a coffee shop—he envisioned a space where people could gather, relax, and share moments over exceptional coffee. What started as a dream rooted in his love for the art of coffee-making soon evolved into a thriving business dedicated to delivering both high-quality beverages and a welcoming atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Driven by a deep commitment to creativity and community, Susanto built MR.COFFEE from the ground up, ensuring every cup served was a reflection of his personal touch and dedication to excellence. His leadership has shaped the coffee shop into a beloved destination for coffee lovers, where each visit promises not just a drink but an experience.</p>
                        <p>Today, MR.COFFEE continues to expand under Susanto's guidance, bringing people together and spreading the joy of great coffee. His vision remains clear-to inspire connections and cultivate a space where everyone feels at home, one cup at a time.</p>
